/**
 * Free-look authoring camera (yomotsu/camera-controls), for the tuner only.
 *
 * The shipped experience is scroll-driven and deliberately not drag-to-orbit
 * (see the Mobile & accessibility notes in the README) — attaching orbit
 * handlers in production is exactly what breaks vertical scrolling on touch.
 * So this exists to *author* keyframes, not to replace the rig: fly to an
 * angle you like, and `toKeyframe()` inverts your camera position back into
 * the `{ p, azimuth, polar, zoom }` line that CAMERA_KEYFRAMES already speaks.
 *
 * While free-look is on, the scroll rig is suspended (`control.suspendCamera`)
 * so the two never fight over camera.position.
